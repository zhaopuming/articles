# 桑德斯深度剖析特朗普国情咨文

# Sen. Bernie Sanders responds to Trump's state of the union

> Let me thank all of you for joining me tonight. I know that it is late and I'm not going to go on for too long. And let me also just congratulate Stacey Abrams for her very very effective response to President Trump's state of the union. Now I think we all know why she would have been a wonderful governer of Georgia. 

感谢大家今晚的参与。我知道现在已经很晚了，所以不会讲太久。我首先祝贺Stacey Abrams（译注：民主党的新发言人），她对特朗普总统的国情咨文做出了非常有力的回应。现在我猜大家都知道为什么她会成为一位出色的佐治亚州州长了。

> I know that this will probably not shock you, but I hate to say this, but not everything Trump said tonight was true or accurate. Tonight, when we talk about economy, tonight, on numerous occasions since he has taken office, President Trump has told the American people that the US economy is the hottest economy anywhere in the world that it is really booming. Well, that may be true, for the members of his MaraLago Country Club, where the price of admission has doubled to $200,000. For thoses folks who go to Trump's club and for the wealthiest people in our nation, Trump is right. The economy is really booming. In fact, for many of President Trump's billionaire friends, the truth is, they have never ever had it so good.

下面这句话可能不会令人惊奇，但我还是不得不再重申一遍：特朗普说的话，并不都真实准确。今晚，当我们讨论经济时，特朗普又拿出了他就任之后多次告诉美国人民的话语：美国经济是世界上最“火热”的经济，而且还在蓬勃发展。好吧，对于特朗普的海湖庄园，这个会费最近已经倍增到20万美元的俱乐部会员们来说，这可能是真的。对于特朗普的私人俱乐部会员们，以及其他美国最富的富豪们来说，特朗普说的完全没错。经济真的在蓬勃发展。实际上，对于特朗普的亿万富翁朋友们来说，真实的情况是，他们的日子从来没这么好过。

> But for the middle class and for the working families of our country, the truth is that the economy is not so great. Over the last year, for example, real inflation accounted for wages for the average American worker is up for all of 1.2 percent, just 9 dollars and 11 cents a week. In fact, real wages for that same worker, that average American worker, are lower today than they were in 1973. Let me repeat that, the average American worker, after adjusting for inflation is earning less today than he or she did 46 years ago, despite huge increases in productivity. 

但对于中产阶级和工人家庭来说，真实的情况则是，现在的经济真没那么好。举个例子，去年一年，美国工人去除通货膨胀的真实平均工资水平，只增长了1.2%，即每周收入只增长了9美元11美分。实际上，对一位普通美国工人来说，今天的真实工资比1973年还低。请允许我重复一遍：尽管整个社会的生产效率已经大大增加，但普通美国工人的平均工资，经过通货膨胀调整之后，比他或她46年之前的工资还低。

> Sadly, millions of American workers are now forced to work two or three jobs just to pay the bills and to keep their heads above water economically. In America today and somehow another President Trump didn't mention this in his speech, we have more wealth and income inequality than almost any major country on earth. And it is more unfair, more unequal now than in any other time since the Gilded Age of the 1920s.

悲哀的是，如今数以百万计的美国工人，不得不兼职两到三份工作，才能勉强糊口，不至于淹没于累累负债中。不知为何特朗普总统在他的演讲中没有提及，在如今的美国，财产与收入的不平等，比世界上任何主要国家都严重。而且，比1920的镀金时代之后任何时代都更严重。

> Yes, the economy is great, for the three wealthiest people in America who own more wealth than the bottom half of our country, a hundred and sixty million Americans. Yes, the economy is great, for the top one percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income in our economy. Yes, the economy is great, for the top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street, who made nearly  twice as much income last year as all a hundred and forty thousand kindergarten teachers in our country. Twenty-five hedge fund managers. Yeah, the economy is great, for the five richest people in America, who have seen their wealth go up by over one hundred billion dollars since Trump was elected, and for corporations that have announced for over one trillion dollars in stock buybacks in 2018 alone. 

是的，对于美国最富的三个人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们比全美一半人口、1亿600万人拥有的全部财产加起来还多。是的，对于最富的1%人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们的收入占我们全部经济新增收入的46%还多。是的，对于华尔街顶尖的25个对冲基金管理人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们去年的收入和全国14万幼儿园教师的总收入一样多。二十五个对冲基金管理人。是的，经济确实很好，好到全美最富的5个人，在特朗普当选之后，财富增长了超过1000亿美元，好到企业集团们仅在2018年就回购了超过一万亿美元的股票。

> Yes, the economy maybe great for those folks, but it is absolutely not booming for the nearly 80 percent of American workers who live paycheck to paycheck, desperately hoping that their child doesn't get sick, praying that their car doesn't break down, or that they don't lose their job. Despite what President Trump says, this is not a "hot" economy, when 43 percent of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cellphone without going into debt. That is not a "hot" economy for ordinary Americans. 

是的，对那些人来说，经济状况确实很好，但是对于接近80%的美国工人来说，经济绝对没有蓬勃发展。他们过着只能靠每个月的工资过活，日日祈求着孩子不要生病，汽车不要坏掉，工作不要丢掉。虽然特朗普总统这么说，但当43%的家庭如果不借款，就供不起房子、买不起食物、养不起孩子、看不起病、坐不起车，甚至买不起一台手机的时候，经济绝对说不上“火热”。对普通美国人来说，这不是火热的经济。

> The economy is not booming, when half of Americans 55 years of age and older have no idea how they will live out the last years of their lives with dignity because they have no retirement savings, and that includes unbelievably 20% of seniors trying to survive on incomes of less than $14,000 a year. I just don't know how anybody, certainly not a senior citizen survives on $14,000 a year. This is not the "strongest economy we have ever had" according to Trump, when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to go to college because they can't afford it and millions more are struggling without rageous levels of student debt, when over 34 millions of Americans have no health insurance, when one out of five of our people cannot afford the medicine prescribed to them by their doctors, and when over 40 million people in our country are living in poverty. 

This is not an economy we should be proud of, when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the developed world, and when life expectancy in the United States has actually gone down for the third year in a row. And as we speak tonigh, let us not forget that in America millions of our people are working for starvation wages, $8 an hour, $9 an hour, $10 an hour. And here is the simple truth: nobody can raise a family, or pay the rent, or take care of the neccessities of life on these poverty wages. But you know what? I didn't hear Donald Trump talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, at least 15 bucks an hour. Some how didn't talk about that.

Tonight President Trump talked about what a great job he has done on trade, but what he had forgot to tell you is that the annual trade deficit has gone up by over 100 billion dollars since he became president and our trade deficit with China and Mexico has gone up by tens of billions of dollars. Meanwhile, since Trump was elected, corporations have shipped a hundred and eighty-five thousand American jobs overseas. 

President Trump also talked tonight about the need to rebuild our country's crumbling infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges, and our water systems, and our wastewater plants, and it is absolutely right. It is an absolute disgrace that in the wealthiest nation on earth we have an infrastructure that is crumbling. But the proposal that he is bringing forth is dead wrong. It is an absurd proposal. Trump would encourage States to sell our nation's highways, our bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street, to wealthy campaign contributors, even to foreign governments. The reality that Trump's plan to privatize our nation's infrastucture is an old idea that has never worked and in fact, never will work.

President Trump said tonight, "We are born free and we will stay free." Well I say, the President Trump, people are not truly free when they can't afford to go to the doctor when they are sick. People are not truly free when they cannot afford to buy the presicription drugs they desperately need. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for lower wages. People are not truly free when they can not afford a decent place in which to live. People certainly are not free when they can not afford to feed their families.

As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1968, "This country has socialism for the rich and rugged indivisualism for the poor." What Dr. King said then was true and it is true today and it remains absolutely unacceptable. 

Tonight Donald Trump, who in less than two years in White House, has seen five aids either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges, claim the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from neccessary oversight and investigations into wrongdoing by both his campaign and his administration. The exact opposite is true. American's strength is based on the rule of law and the fact that no one, not even the President of the United States is above it. 

Tonight, in terms of crime, Trump talked about a terrible and heinous murder in Reno Nevada committed by an undocumented immigrant who happens to be Latino. In fact, as many of you will recall, over the last several years, Trump has talked time and time again about crimes committed by undocumented Latino immigrants. His demonization of Latinos is nothing less than racist. It is wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in the United States than the general public. But I want you to think about something for a moment. Isn't it strange that when we talk about terrible crimes committed in the United States or in the state of Nevada, Donal Trump forgot to mention that in 2017 a white men named Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded 851 in the deadliest shooting in modern American history. That also happend in Nevada. Now how come Trump didn't mention that if he is concerned about crime, how come Trmp didn't talk about one of the worst mass murders in American history. Needless to say he also didn't mention the need for commen-sense gun safety legislation, which would lower the terrible rate of mass shootings in our country.

Tonight, Donald Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-woman attacks coming from the far right, at a time when we see an unprecedent that in coordinated attack against a woman's right to truce. It is incredibly important that we fight to make sure that every women in this country has the right to control her own body.

Tonight, Donal Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, President Trump, you don't help people suffering from opioid addiction by writing a budget which calls for a trillion dollars cut to Medicaid. That would be a devastation, a devastating moment in the fight against the opioid addiction. 

Now as important as it is to respond to what President Trump said tonight, it is even more important to discuss some of what Trump refused to talk about, which happens to include some of the most important issues facing our country and the entire world. 

Now how can a President of the United States give a state of the union speech and not mention, not one word, about climate change when the leading scientist of the world tell us that climate change is real, that climate change is caused by human activity, and that clilmate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States and in much of the world. Further, the scientists tell us that we have a very short 12 years, not a lot of time, in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy, if we are going to have a planet that is healthy and habitable for our children and our grand children. Somehow or another Donald Trump just forgot to talk about that. 

Trump also forgot to discuss the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarentee health care to all people as a right. Now how can he ignore the fact that we spend far more per capita on health care than any other country on earth while at the same time tens of millions of our fellow Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Somehow or another, Trump forgot to get that issue.

How can President Trump not discuss the terrible attacks that we are seeing to undermine the fundamentals of American democracy, which includes the disastrous Citizens United supreme court decision that allows billionairs to buy elections. Trump talked a lot about freedom tonight, but somehow or another, he didn't talk about governers' efforts all across this country, governers who are trying to suppress the boat and make it harder for poor people or people of color to vote. You can't talk about freedom in America and ignore the massive amounts of voter suppression taking place, denying people the right to participate in our democracy. 

Donal Trump talked about the economy, but he forgot to mention the fact that state after state is doing the right thing and is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But I didn't hear President Trump say that he would work with me and other advocates of a living wage, to raise the minimum wage at federal level to fifteen bucks an hour. Somehow he didn't get into that.

How could President Trump not mention the words: Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid in his state of the union speech when he promised over and over again during his campaign. Remember that? That he would not cut these programs. Could it be because his budget proposed massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security in direct violation of his campaign pledge.

How could Trump not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyber warfare interfered in our election in 2016 is intefering in democratic elections all over the world and according to the heads of his own national security agencies attempted to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.

How can the President say nothing about Yemen, where the worst humanitarian crisis in the world is currently taking place, brought on by a Saudi-led war that the United States is supporting. And just yesterday, a CNN report detailed how our Saudi and Emirati allies have been giving US made weapons to Al Qeada-linked fighters in Yemen and have also fallen into the hands of Iranian backed Houti rebels. This war is a disaster which is why the Senate passed a resolution that I sponsored last December, calling on the President to end our support for that terrible war, and why colleagues in both the House and the Senate reintroduced that legislation last week. This is an enormously important foreign policy issue, it speaks to our relationship with a despotic regime in Saudi Arabia. Somehow Trump forgot to mention that.

President Trump has stated tonight and over and over and over and over again that building a wall on the Mexican border is a "national emergency". In fact, he shut down the government and caused enormous pain and uncertainty for some 800,000 federal employees who are forced to go to work but were not paid all because of his insistence on that wall. No, President Trump, building a wall is not an emergency. In terms of immigration in this country, what we need to do is not to waste billions of dollars on a wall but to finally address the need for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people. It is inhumane and not what America stands for, that tiny children at the border have been torn apart from their parents. It is disgraceful that 1.8 million young people raised in United States, and who know no other country but United States have lost their legal protection under the DACA program because of Trump's actions. It is heartbreaking that almost 11 million undocumented people living in this country, the overwhelming majority of whom are hardworking and law-abiding, worry everyday about being deported and seperated from their loved ones. 

What a President of the United States is supposed to do, and I think in a certain sense almost all presidents in recent history have understood that, is that when you're president, you bring our people together, whether they are black or white or Latino or the Asian American, Native American, whether they are men or women, whether they are gay or straight. That's what a president is supposed to do. But in an unprecedented way, that is not what this president is doing. In fact, he is trying to divide us up, he is trying to help one group turn against another group, and that is certainly not what this country is supposed to be about.

Trump said tonight that we should "govern not as two parties, but as one nation". I agree, but Trump's agenda of providing tax breaks to billionaires while throwing millions of Americans off of health insurance is the exact opposite of what the American people want. If Trump truly wants to govern in a bipartisan manner, let's take a look at what the overwhelming majority of the American people want, in other words, I know this is a radical idea, but I say to the President of the United States, why don't you do what the American people want you to do rather than wealthy campaign contributors won. Let me give you some examples.

- A Fox Nes poll conducted last month shows that 70% of Americans support a tax increase on families making over 10 millions.
- According to Reuters 70% of the American people including 52% of Republicans support Medicare for all, they understand that the current health system is not working and they want to join every other country on earth in making health care a right, not a privilege.
- Another poll found that 72% of the American people, including 51% of Republicans, want to expand Social Security benefits, make sure that our elderly people can retire in dignity, and do that by increasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires.
- According to Gallup, 76% of the American people, including large majorities of Republicans and Democrats, want us to spend a trillion dollars on an infrastructure plan to create up to 15 million good-paying jobs.
- The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 92% of Americans want Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices, 92 percent.
- That same poll also found that 72% of Americans, including three-quarters of Republicans, want the freedom to buy low-cost prescription drugs from Canada.
- Gallup tells us that 64% of Americans, including 51% of Republicans, believe marijuana should be legal, and that tells me that we should end the disastrous war on drugs.
- Quinnipiac tells us American support by over 94% requiring background checks for all gun purchases.
- CBS has found that 87% of Americans, including 79% of Republicans, want to allow immigrants who are brought to the United States as children to stay in our country.
- And according to a July 2018 survey, paid for by the Koch brothers, 66% of Americans believe "government paid college tuition is an effective solution to social barriers".
- Sixty-five percent of Americans believe that a fifteen dollar minimum wage is an effective solution to low wages.
- 69% of Americans believe that we need more regulation of Wall Street.
- And 69% of Americans also believe we should be increasing government assistance for child care.

My fellow Americans, if the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to pass these enormouslly popular initiatives, why can't Congress pass them, why isn't Congress and the White House doing what the American people want them to do? And the answer, frankly, is not complicated. The answer has everything to do with the power of the moneyed interests. Wall Street, big drug companies, huge health insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry, multinational corporations in the billionaire class. All of these groups are spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to get Congress to do their bidding.

But while they may have the money, and God Only Knows, they have an endless supply of money, we have something that is more powerful on our side, and that is that we have the people.

They have the money, we have the people.

If we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the shrinking middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, and increasing voter turnout, and bringing young people into the political process, let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class must learn that they cannot have it all, our government belongs to each and every one of us, not just the few. Together let us fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Let us end unbridled greed. Let us create the kind of America that we know we can become.

Thank you all and have a great night.
