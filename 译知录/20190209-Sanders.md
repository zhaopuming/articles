# 参议员桑德斯深度剖析特朗普国情咨文

# Sen. Bernie Sanders responds to Trump's state of the union

本文是参议员伯尼·桑德斯在特朗普进行国情咨文演讲之后，当晚就做出的回击演讲。桑德斯是民主党最受尊敬的老议员，也是全美最受欢迎的议员，没有之一。2016年竞选总统，在民主党内初选中惜败于希拉里，后面的故事大家都知道了。2020年，他很可能是打败特朗普的美国救星。他的政治观点偏向于社会主义，在民生、经济、环保、全球化合作等领域，都和我们中国的观点相融。本文的内容是我听写出英文稿，之后再翻译成中文稿的。下面是演讲稿与翻译：

> Let me thank all of you for joining me tonight. I know that it is late and I'm not going to go on for too long. And let me also just congratulate Stacey Abrams for her very very effective response to President Trump's state of the union. Now I think we all know why she would have been a wonderful governer of Georgia. 

感谢大家今晚的参与。我知道现在已经很晚了，所以不会讲太久。我首先祝贺Stacey Abrams（译注：民主党对总统演讲的正式回应的发言人），她对特朗普总统的国情咨文做出了非常有力的回应。现在我猜大家都知道为什么她会成为一位出色的佐治亚州州长了。

> I know that this will probably not shock you, but I hate to say this, but not everything Trump said tonight was true or accurate. Tonight, when we talk about economy, tonight, on numerous occasions since he has taken office, President Trump has told the American people that the US economy is the hottest economy anywhere in the world that it is really booming. Well, that may be true, for the members of his MaraLago Country Club, where the price of admission has doubled to $200,000. For thoses folks who go to Trump's club and for the wealthiest people in our nation, Trump is right. The economy is really booming. In fact, for many of President Trump's billionaire friends, the truth is, they have never ever had it so good.

下面这句话可能不会令人惊奇，但我还是不得不再重申一遍：特朗普说的话，并不都真实准确。今晚，当我们讨论经济时，特朗普又拿出了他就任之后多次告诉美国民众的话语：美国经济是世界上最“火热”的经济，而且还在蓬勃发展。好吧，对于特朗普的海湖庄园，这个会费最近已经倍增到20万美元的俱乐部会员们来说，这可能是真的。对于特朗普的私人俱乐部会员们，以及其他美国最富的富豪们来说，特朗普说的完全没错。经济真的在蓬勃发展。实际上，对于特朗普的亿万富翁朋友们来说，真实的情况是，他们的日子从来没这么好过。

> But for the middle class and for the working families of our country, the truth is that the economy is not so great. Over the last year, for example, real inflation accounted for wages for the average American worker is up for all of 1.2 percent, just 9 dollars and 11 cents a week. In fact, real wages for that same worker, that average American worker, are lower today than they were in 1973. Let me repeat that, the average American worker, after adjusting for inflation is earning less today than he or she did 46 years ago, despite huge increases in productivity. Sadly, millions of American workers are now forced to work two or three jobs just to pay the bills and to keep their heads above water economically.

但对于中产阶级和工人家庭来说，真实的情况则是，现在的经济真没那么好。举个例子，去年一年，美国工人去除通货膨胀的真实平均工资水平，只增长了1.2%，即每周收入只增长了9美元11美分。实际上，对一位普通美国工人来说，今天的真实工资比1973年还低。请允许我重复一遍：普通美国工人的平均工资，经过通货膨胀调整之后，比他或她46年之前的工资还要低，尽管整个社会的生产效率已经大大增加。悲哀的是，如今数以百万计的美国工人，不得不兼职两到三份工作，才能勉强糊口，不至于淹没在累累负债之中。

> In America today and somehow another President Trump didn't mention this in his speech, we have more wealth and income inequality than almost any major country on earth. And it is more unfair, more unequal now than in any other time since the Gilded Age of the 1920s.

不知为何，特朗普总统在他的演讲中没有提及，在如今的美国，财产与收入的不平等，比世界上任何主要国家都严重。而且，自从1920的镀金时代之后，任何时代都没有如今这么不公平，这么两极分化。

> Yes, the economy is great, for the three wealthiest people in America who own more wealth than the bottom half of our country, a hundred and sixty million Americans. Yes, the economy is great, for the top one percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income in our economy. Yes, the economy is great, for the top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street, who made nearly  twice as much income last year as all a hundred and forty thousand kindergarten teachers in our country. Twenty-five hedge fund managers. Yeah, the economy is great, for the five richest people in America, who have seen their wealth go up by over one hundred billion dollars since Trump was elected, and for corporations that have announced for over one trillion dollars in stock buybacks in 2018 alone. 

是的，对于美国最富的三个人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们比全美一半人口、1亿600万人拥有的全部财产加起来还多。是的，对于最富的1%人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们的收入占我们全部经济新增收入的46%还多。是的，对于华尔街顶尖的25个对冲基金管理人来说，经济确实很好，好到他们去年的收入和全国14万幼儿园教师的总收入一样多。二十五个对冲基金管理人。是的，经济确实很好，好到全美最富的5个人，在特朗普当选之后，财富增长了超过1000亿美元，好到企业集团们仅在2018年就回购了超过一万亿美元的股票。

> Yes, the economy maybe great for those folks, but it is absolutely not booming for the nearly 80 percent of American workers who live paycheck to paycheck, desperately hoping that their child doesn't get sick, praying that their car doesn't break down, or that they don't lose their job. Despite what President Trump says, this is not a "hot" economy, when 43 percent of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cellphone without going into debt. That is not a "hot" economy for ordinary Americans. 

是的，对那些人来说，经济状况确实很好，但是对于接近80%的美国工人来说，经济绝对没有蓬勃发展。他们过着只能靠每个月的工资过活，日日祈求着孩子不要生病，汽车不要坏掉，工作不要丢掉。虽然特朗普总统这么说，但当43%的家庭如果不借款，就供不起房子、买不起食物、养不起孩子、看不起病、坐不起车，甚至买不起一台手机的时候，经济绝对说不上“火热”。对普通美国人来说，这不是“火热”的经济。

> The economy is not booming, when half of Americans 55 years of age and older have no idea how they will live out the last years of their lives with dignity because they have no retirement savings, and that includes unbelievably 20% of seniors trying to survive on incomes of less than $14,000 a year. I just don't know how anybody, certainly not a senior citizen survives on $14,000 a year. 

当美国55岁以上的老人中有半数都没有退休存款，无法想象他们晚年该如何有体面地度过时，经济算不上蓬勃发展。这其中，有20%的老年人竟靠着不足$14,000美元的年收入挣扎度日。我实在想象不到，任何人，更何况是老年人，如何靠1万4千美元生存一年。

> This is not the "strongest economy we have ever had" according to Trump, when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to go to college because they can't afford it and millions more are struggling without rageous levels of student debt, when over 34 millions of Americans have no health insurance, when one out of five of our people cannot afford the medicine prescribed to them by their doctors, and when over 40 million people in our country are living in poverty. 

当数十万计年轻人因为负担不起学费而无法上大学，当数百万计学生挣扎于令人绝望的学生贷款，当超过3400万美国人无法享受医疗保险，当五个人中就有一个无法负担医生开具的处方药，当超过4000万人仍然挣扎在贫困线以下的时候，这并不是像特朗普所说的“我们历史上最强劲的经济”。

> This is not an economy we should be proud of, when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the developed world, and when life expectancy in the United States has actually gone down for the third year in a row. And as we speak tonight, let us not forget that in America millions of our people are working for starvation wages, $8 an hour, $9 an hour, $10 an hour. And here is the simple truth: nobody can raise a family, or pay the rent, or take care of the neccessities of life on these poverty wages. But you know what? I didn't hear Donald Trump talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, at least 15 bucks an hour. Some how didn't talk about that.

当我们拥有发达国家中最高的儿童贫困率，当美国的预期寿命连续第三年下降的时候，这并不是一个值得我们骄傲的经济。就在我演讲的今晚，请不要忘记，在美国，有数百万人还工作在填不饱肚子的工资，时薪8美元、9美元、10美元。而且这是一个很简单的事实：没人能够用这么微薄的收入支撑家庭，支付房租，担负生活必需。但是你知道吗？我没听到唐纳德·特朗普提到要提高最低工资到至少时薪15美元这个可以生存的水平。不知为何，他没有谈到这件事。

> Tonight President Trump talked about what a great job he has done on trade, but what he had forgot to tell you is that the annual trade deficit has gone up by over 100 billion dollars since he became president and our trade deficit with China and Mexico has gone up by tens of billions of dollars. Meanwhile, since Trump was elected, corporations have shipped a hundred and eighty-five thousand American jobs overseas. 

今晚，特朗普总统谈到了他在贸易上杰出的成就。但他忘记告诉你，自从他就任以来，美国对中国和墨西哥的贸易逆差，已经扩大了数百亿美元。而与此同时，自从特朗普当选以来，企业界已经把18万5千个美国工作岗位迁移到海外。

> President Trump also talked tonight about the need to rebuild our country's crumbling infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges, and our water systems, and our wastewater plants, and it is absolutely right. It is an absolute disgrace that in the wealthiest nation on earth we have an infrastructure that is crumbling. But the proposal that he is bringing forth is dead wrong. It is an absurd proposal. Trump would encourage States to sell our nation's highways, our bridges, and other vital infrastructure to Wall Street, to wealthy campaign contributors, even to foreign governments. The reality that Trump's plan to privatize our nation's infrastucture is an old idea that has never worked and in fact, never will work.

特朗普总统今晚还谈到我们应当重建国内衰败的基础建设，重建我们的公路，我们的桥梁，我们的饮水系统，我们的污水处理厂。这一点完全正确。作为世界上最富裕的国家，我们的基础建设却日渐衰败，确实是令人羞耻的事情。但是他提出的解决方案却是大错特错。简直就是荒唐的方案。特朗普鼓励各州把我们国家的高速公路，我们的桥梁，以及其他关系到国计民生的基础设施贩卖给华尔街，贩卖给富裕的竞选捐献人，甚至贩卖给外国政府。特朗普的计划实质上就是国有基础设施私有化，而这是一个很古老的概念，实际上从来没有成功过，也永远不会成功。

> President Trump said tonight, "We are born free and we will stay free." Well I say, the President Trump, people are not truly free when they can't afford to go to the doctor when they are sick. People are not truly free when they cannot afford to buy the presicription drugs they desperately need. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for lower wages. People are not truly free when they can not afford a decent place in which to live. People certainly are not free when they can not afford to feed their families.

特朗普总统今晚说：“我们生来自由，而且会永葆自由。”但是我得说，特朗普总统，人民若生病时看不起医生，哪里谈得上真正自由？人民若买不起急需的处方药，哪里谈得上真正自由？人民若无法体面地退休，哪里谈得上真正自由？人民若筋疲力尽于不断延长的工作时间，却拿到更低的工资，如何谈得上真正自由？人民若买不起一隅陋室，有居所可依，如何谈得上真正自由？人民若连家人的饮食都供养不起，绝对谈不上自由。

> As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1968, "This country has socialism for the rich and rugged indivisualism for the poor." What Dr. King said then was true and it is true today and it remains absolutely unacceptable. 

马丁路德金1968年就说过：“这个国家对富人来说是社会主义，而对穷人来说是艰辛的个人主义。” 他说的这句话当时完全正确，但到现在还是如此，简直无法令人接受。

> Tonight Donald Trump, who in less than two years in White House, has seen five aids either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges, claim the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from neccessary oversight and investigations into wrongdoing by both his campaign and his administration. The exact opposite is true. American's strength is based on the rule of law and the fact that no one, not even the President of the United States is above it. 

今晚的特朗普，在白宫还没坐够两年，就已经有5位左右臂膀服罪或者被判刑了。但他今晚仍然声称，美国的经济若要维系强劲，他必须自由不受监管，他的竞选组织和政府必须不受调查。但实际上真正的情况正相反。美国强大的根基，正是法制的无上规则：任何人，甚至美国总统，都不能逾越在法律之上。

> Tonight, in terms of crime, Trump talked about a terrible and heinous murder in Reno Nevada committed by an undocumented immigrant who happens to be Latino. In fact, as many of you will recall, over the last several years, Trump has talked time and time again about crimes committed by undocumented Latino immigrants. His demonization of Latinos is nothing less than racist. It is wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in the United States than the general public. But I want you to think about something for a moment. Isn't it strange that when we talk about terrible crimes committed in the United States or in the state of Nevada, Donal Trump forgot to mention that in 2017 a white men named Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and wounded 851 in the deadliest shooting in modern American history. That also happend in Nevada. Now how come Trump didn't mention that if he is concerned about crime, how come Trmp didn't talk about one of the worst mass murders in American history. Needless to say he also didn't mention the need for commen-sense gun safety legislation, which would lower the terrible rate of mass shootings in our country.

今晚，谈论到犯罪的时候，特朗普提到了再内华达州Reno市发生的一件恐怖而可憎的谋杀案，凶手是一个无证移民，恰好是拉美裔。实际上，可能大家都能想起来，最近几年，特朗普次复一次地讲到过拉美裔无证移民所犯的罪恶。但我要说，他对拉美裔人民的妖魔化，无异于种族歧视。他这么说错误的，而且也不符合事实。实际上在美国，拉美裔无证移民的犯罪率比普通民众更低。但是我希望你思考一件事情。当他谈到美国国内，尤其内华达州内发生的恐怖犯罪时，唐纳德·特朗普忘记了提到2017年，一个叫Stephen Paddock的白人，杀死了58人，伤害851人，犯下了现代美国历史上最致命的枪击罪案。这个罪案也发生在内华达。你不觉得这很奇怪吗？请想想，如果特朗普真的关心犯罪的议题，他怎么不谈论美国历史上最严重的大屠杀罪案呢？不用说，他也完全没提到合理枪支管理法的需要，而那正是降低我们国家高到恐怖的屠杀式枪击案犯罪率的最佳途径。

> Tonight, Donald Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-woman attacks coming from the far right, at a time when we see an unprecedent that in coordinated attack against a woman's right to truce. It is incredibly important that we fight to make sure that every women in this country has the right to control her own body.

今晚，唐纳德·特朗普重复了一些来自极端右翼的最极端反女性的言论。而这恰好是一个有组织地攻击女性自我选择权最为猖狂的时期。而我认为我们为这个国家的女性争取控制他们自己身体的权利是非常重要的。

> Tonight, Donal Trump correctly talked about the need to address the opioid crisis. Well, President Trump, you don't help people suffering from opioid addiction by writing a budget which calls for a trillion dollars cut to Medicaid. That would be a devastation, a devastating moment in the fight against the opioid addiction. 

今晚，唐纳德·特朗普谈到了处理阿片类药物泛滥危机的必要性，我认为是正确的。但是，特朗普总统，你从Medicaid砍掉了1万亿美元的预算，这样并不能帮助那些遭受阿片类药物依赖困扰的人们。反而，那样会给他们带来绝望，在抗争阿片依赖的战争中带来绝望的时刻。

> Now as important as it is to respond to what President Trump said tonight, it is even more important to discuss some of what Trump refused to talk about, which happens to include some of the most important issues facing our country and the entire world. 

我认为，回应特朗普总统今晚谈到的内容很重要，但讨论他拒绝谈论的一些话题，更加重要。这其中恰好包括了我们国家、甚至整个世界正面临的重要问题。

> Now how can a President of the United States give a state of the union speech and not mention, not one word, about climate change when the leading scientist of the world tell us that climate change is real, that climate change is caused by human activity, and that clilmate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States and in much of the world. Further, the scientists tell us that we have a very short 12 years, not a lot of time, in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy, if we are going to have a planet that is healthy and habitable for our children and our grand children. Somehow or another Donald Trump just forgot to talk about that. 

首先，作为美利坚合众国的总统，在国情咨文演讲中，为何只字不提气候变迁的话题？全世界的顶尖科学家们都已经告诉大家气候变迁是真实存在的，气候变迁是由人类活动导致的，而且气候变迁已经给美国和世界很多地区带来了巨大的损害。不仅如此，科学家们还告诉我们，如果我们还想为子孙后代留下一个健康、宜居的星球的话，必须迅速转变全球的能源系统，摆脱对化石燃料的依赖，转用高能效、可持续的新能源。要做到这一点，我们只剩下12年了，而不是很多人以为的为时尚早。但不知为何，唐纳德·特朗普就是忘了谈及这个话题。

> Trump also forgot to discuss the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth not to guarentee health care to all people as a right. Now how can he ignore the fact that we spend far more per capita on health care than any other country on earth while at the same time tens of millions of our fellow Americans are uninsured or underinsured. Somehow or another, Trump forgot to get that issue.

特朗普还忘了讨论我们的国际尴尬：美国是全球所有主要国家中，唯一不保证全民医疗，不承认医疗是人的权利的国家。他怎么能忽略掉这样的一个事实：美国作为全世界人均医疗费用最高的国家，但却仍有数以千万计的美国同胞享受不到医疗保障，或者保障不全？不知道为什么，特朗普忘记了这个话题。

> How can President Trump not discuss the terrible attacks that we are seeing to undermine the fundamentals of American democracy, which includes the disastrous Citizens United supreme court decision that allows billionairs to buy elections. Trump talked a lot about freedom tonight, but somehow or another, he didn't talk about governers' efforts all across this country, governers who are trying to suppress the vote and make it harder for poor people or people of color to vote. You can't talk about freedom in America and ignore the massive amounts of voter suppression taking place, denying people the right to participate in our democracy. 

特朗普总统为何不谈论近期发生的种种破坏美国民主根基的攻击？其中包括Citizens United案件，这个最高法院灾难性的判决，导致亿万富翁们可以直接合法贿赂选举。特朗普今晚讲了很多关于自由的话题，但是他并没有谈到全国各个州长们试图阻挠投票，让穷人和有色人种更难参与投票的事情。你不能一遍谈论美国的自由，一边又忽略掉大量存在的阻挠投票事件，忽略掉许多人被剥夺了参与国家民主权利的事实。


> Donal Trump talked about the economy, but he forgot to mention the fact that state after state is doing the right thing and is raising the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But I didn't hear President Trump say that he would work with me and other advocates of a living wage, to raise the minimum wage at federal level to fifteen bucks an hour. Somehow he didn't get into that.

唐纳德·特朗普谈到了经济，但是他忘记提及各州接连不断地做出正确选择，把最低工资提高到时薪15美元这个生存线。尽管我和其他过会的议员一直在倡导将提高最低工资的议题扩展到整个联邦级别，但不知为什么，特朗普总统没有谈到会与国会合作，解决这个问题的事情。

> How could President Trump not mention the words: Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid in his state of the union speech when he promised over and over again during his campaign. Remember that? That he would not cut these programs. Could it be because his budget proposed massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security in direct violation of his campaign pledge.

特朗普总统又为何在整篇演讲里只字未提这几个关键词：社会保障、医保或医疗补助？尤其考虑到，他在竞选时期，曾多次向选民保证，不会削减这些民生政策的开支。可正是由于他的预算议案，大大削减了医保、医疗补助和社会保障开支，直接违反了他的竞选许诺。

> How could Trump not talk about the reality that Russia, through cyber warfare interfered in our election in 2016 is intefering in democratic elections all over the world and according to the heads of his own national security agencies attempted to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.

特朗普总统为何不谈及俄罗斯？通过网络战争，俄罗斯干涉了我们2016年的选举，现在也正在干涉世界各地的民主选举。而根据特朗普自己选的国家安全局局长所说，俄罗斯也干涉了刚刚发生的2018年中期选举。

> How can the President say nothing about Yemen, where the worst humanitarian crisis in the world is currently taking place, brought on by a Saudi-led war that the United States is supporting. And just yesterday, a CNN report detailed how our Saudi and Emirati allies have been giving US made weapons to Al Qeada-linked fighters in Yemen and have also fallen into the hands of Iranian backed Houthi rebels. This war is a disaster which is why the Senate passed a resolution that I sponsored last December, calling on the President to end our support for that terrible war, and why colleagues in both the House and the Senate reintroduced that legislation last week. This is an enormously important foreign policy issue, it speaks to our relationship with a despotic regime in Saudi Arabia. Somehow Trump forgot to mention that.

特朗普总统又怎么能不谈及也门危机，这个惨绝人寰的人道主义灾难？而导致这场灾难的，正是沙特阿拉伯挑起、美国协助的战争。仅仅就在昨天，CNN详细报道了我们的沙特和阿联酋盟友们，是如何把美国支援的武器转送给也门的基地组织关联游击队的？而且这些武器同时也落入了伊朗支持的胡赛武装手中。这场战争是一场灾难，因此我在国会发起了一个议案，，呼吁总统停止美国对这场可怕的战争的支持，并在去年十二月获得了通过。但特朗普政府并没有执行。上周，众议院与参议员一起，重新引入了这个法案。这是一个极端重要的外交政策，它决定了我们与沙特专横统治的政体之间的关系。但特朗普又忘了在演讲中提到它。

> President Trump has stated tonight and over and over and over and over again that building a wall on the Mexican border is a "national emergency". In fact, he shut down the government and caused enormous pain and uncertainty for some 800,000 federal employees who are forced to go to work but were not paid all because of his insistence on that wall. No, President Trump, building a wall is not an emergency. In terms of immigration in this country, what we need to do is not to waste billions of dollars on a wall but to finally address the need for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people. It is inhumane and not what America stands for, that tiny children at the border have been torn apart from their parents. It is disgraceful that 1.8 million young people raised in United States, and who know no other country but United States have lost their legal protection under the DACA program because of Trump's actions. It is heartbreaking that almost 11 million undocumented people living in this country, the overwhelming majority of whom are hardworking and law-abiding, worry everyday about being deported and seperated from their loved ones. 

特朗普总统今晚又双叒重申，在墨西哥边界修建一堵墙，是“国家紧急事态”。实际上，他为了这堵墙，甚至不惜关闭政府，导致80万联邦公务员不得不在没有工资的情况下继续工作，给他们带来了巨大的痛苦，以及对未来的不确定性。特朗普总统，修那堵墙可不是紧急的事情。关于这个国家的移民政策，真正应当采取的措施，不是浪费数十亿美元去修一堵没用的墙，而是采取行动，开启可行的移民政策改革，包括探索帮助数百万无证移民转化为合法公民的途径。将幼弱的儿童与他们的父母在边境生生分离，不仅不人道，而且绝对不符合美国精神。而且令人感到羞耻的是，一百八十万生在美国长在美国的孩子，除了美国不认识其他任何国家，却因为特朗普的政令，而在DACA政策中失去了自己的合法保护权。国内接近一千一百万无证移民，绝大多数都遵守法律，努力工作，但却不得不时刻担心被驱逐出境，与亲人分离，实在令人伤心。


> What a President of the United States is supposed to do, and I think in a certain sense almost all presidents in recent history have understood that, is that when you're president, you bring our people together, whether they are black or white or Latino or the Asian American, Native American, whether they are men or women, whether they are gay or straight. That's what a president is supposed to do. But in an unprecedented way, that is not what this president is doing. In fact, he is trying to divide us up, he is trying to help one group turn against another group, and that is certainly not what this country is supposed to be about.

我觉得，作为美国总统，应该做的，而且几乎历史上所有总统都明白的是：既然你是总统，就应当把人民团结起来，不论他们是黑人还是白人，是亚裔还是印第安，不论他们是男是女，是同性恋还是异性恋。这才是总统应该做得事情。但是现在这位总统，却和以往的总统都做的相反。实际上，他一直想着分裂我们，他一直在帮助一个人群去压迫另一个人群，而这绝对不是这个国家应该出现的事情。

> Trump said tonight that we should "govern not as two parties, but as one nation". I agree, but Trump's agenda of providing tax breaks to billionaires while throwing millions of Americans off of health insurance is the exact opposite of what the American people want. If Trump truly wants to govern in a bipartisan manner, let's take a look at what the overwhelming majority of the American people want, in other words, I know this is a radical idea, but I say to the President of the United States, why don't you do what the American people want you to do rather than wealthy campaign contributors won. Let me give you some examples.

特朗普今晚说我们应当“不是作为两个党，而是作为一个国家来管理”。我同意这一点。但是特朗普的政策，在为亿万富翁巨额减税的同时，把数百万美国人丢出医保之外，这恰与美国人民所希望的背道而驰。如果特朗普真的想团结两党，共同治理国家，就应该看看绝大多数的美国民众想要的是什么。换句话说，我知道这是个激进的想法，但是我想对美国总统说，问什么你不做美国人民想要你做的事情，而只听那些富豪竞选捐赠人的想法？下面我举些例子。

> - A Fox News poll conducted last month shows that 70% of Americans support a tax increase on families making over 10 millions.

- 上个月Fox News所做的一个民意调查显示，70%的美国人支持对收入超过1000万美元的家庭增加税收。

> - According to Reuters 70% of the American people including 52% of Republicans support Medicare for all, they understand that the current health system is not working and they want to join every other country on earth in making health care a right, not a privilege.

- 根据路透社的统计，70%的美国人，其中包括52%的共和党人，都支持将医保计划MediaCare推广到全民。他们知道现在的医保系统并不成功，他们也希望能美国能和其他所有的国家一样，把医疗认定为人人都享受的公民权，而不是一种特权。

> - Another poll found that 72% of the American people, including 51% of Republicans, want to expand Social Security benefits, make sure that our elderly people can retire in dignity, and do that by increasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires.

- 路透社另一个民意调查发现72%的美国人，包括51%的共和党人，希望扩大社会保障福利，确保我们的老年人能够老有所依，体面地退休。而且他们都赞同通过增加百万富翁和亿万富翁的税收来做这件事。

> - According to Gallup, 76% of the American people, including large majorities of Republicans and Democrats, want us to spend a trillion dollars on an infrastructure plan to create up to 15 million good-paying jobs.

- 根据盖勒普的统计，76%的美国人，包括大多数共和党人和民主党人，同意政府开展万亿美元级别的基础建设计划，并创造1500万份薪金优厚的工作岗位。

> - The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 92% of Americans want Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices, 92 percent. That same poll also found that 72% of Americans, including three-quarters of Republicans, want the freedom to buy low-cost prescription drugs from Canada.

- Kaiser家庭基金会发现，92%的美国人希望Medicare医保向医药公司议价，降低处方药价格。是的，百分之九十二。 这次民意调查也发现，72%的美国人，包括三分之二的共和党人，希望获得自由购买加拿大的低价处方药的权利。
  
> - Quinnipiac tells us American support by over 94% requiring background checks for all gun purchases.

- Quinnipiac的民意调查告诉我们，超过94%的美国人支持所有的枪支购买都必须进行背景调查。

> - CBS has found that 87% of Americans, including 79% of Republicans, want to allow immigrants who are brought to the United States as children to stay in our country.

- CBS发现，87%的美国人，包括79%的共和党人，希望允许那些从孩提时代就被带到美国生活的移民，继续留在我们的国家。
 
> - And according to a July 2018 survey, paid for by the Koch brothers, 66% of Americans believe "government paid college tuition is an effective solution to social barriers".

- 而且，根据2018年7月Koch兄弟赞助的一个调查，66%的美国人相信“政府补贴大学学费是一个解决社会壁垒问题的有效方案”。

> - Sixty-five percent of Americans believe that a fifteen dollar minimum wage is an effective solution to low wages.

- 65%的美国人相信15美元最低工资标准是解决低收入问题的有效方案。

> - 69% of Americans believe that we need more regulation of Wall Street.

- 69%的美国人认为我们需要更严格地监管华尔街。

> - And 69% of Americans also believe we should be increasing government assistance for child care.

- 69%的美国人认为我们需要增加政府对儿童护理的资助。

> My fellow Americans, if the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to pass these enormouslly popular initiatives, why can't Congress pass them, why isn't Congress and the White House doing what the American people want them to do? And the answer, frankly, is not complicated. The answer has everything to do with the power of the moneyed interests. Wall Street, big drug companies, huge health insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry, multinational corporations in the billionaire class. All of these groups are spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to get Congress to do their bidding.

我的美国同胞们，如果绝大多数美国人都想要我们去推动这些极受欢迎的法案，为什么国会没能通过它们？为什么国会和白宫，不按照人民的意愿去行动？坦白地说，这个问题的答案并不复杂。答案就是，金钱利益的力量，实在是太强大了。华尔街，医药巨头，医保巨头，石油产业，跨国公司，所有那些亿万富翁的阶层，所有的这些团体，都在有组织地，花费数以亿计的金钱，操纵国会为他们服务。

> But while they may have the money, and God Only Knows, they have an endless supply of money, we have something that is more powerful on our side, and that is that we have the people.

虽然他们有大量的金钱——只有上帝才知道他们到底有多少钱——但我们这一方也有一个更加强大的武器，那就是，我们有人民。

> They have the money, we have the people.

他们有金钱，我们有人民。

> If we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the shrinking middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, and increasing voter turnout, and bringing young people into the political process, let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class must learn that they cannot have it all, our government belongs to each and every one of us, not just the few. Together let us fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Let us end unbridled greed. Let us create the kind of America that we know we can become.

如果我们真的想改变我们的国家，如果我们真的想重建萎缩的中产阶级，如果我们真的想激活我们的民主，增加投票参与率，吸引更多的人来参与政治活动，那就请大家团结起来奋斗，战胜那些无止尽的贪婪正不断破坏我们国家的统治阶级！亿万富翁们必须知道他们不能想什么就有什么，知道政府是属于每一个人民，而不是小部分人。团结起来，让我们为了经济公平、社会公平、种族公平和环境公平而奋斗。让我们一起结束那脱缰而奔的贪婪。让我们一起创造，我们梦想中的美国！

> Thank you all and have a great night.

感谢大家，祝愿你们晚安。
