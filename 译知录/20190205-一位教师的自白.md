这是一位老师在Reddit上的评论，原贴链接是这个：<https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/amgh0c/french_teachers_who_find_themselves_at_breaking/efmani5>


原贴的标题是：

> French teachers who find themselves at breaking point after years of being asked to do more with less took to the streets of Paris, Lyon, Nice and Bordeaux on Saturday, demanding a salary increase and better conditions for teachers and students.

这个帖子讲的是法国的教师们上周六举行了全国范围的大游行，要求提高薪资，提高教师与学生的生存条件。

然后，一位读者/u/NoWayRay评论道：

> Not a world of difference in the UK and US. Other places too probably. Why is one of the most important professions so routinely undervalued? I really don't understand why people go into teaching in those circumstances, I'm just grateful they do.

“英国、美国也都是一样糟糕。其他地方可能也是如此。为什么最重要的职业，总是被政府如此反复地忽视? 我实在不明白，这样差的条件下，为什么还有人愿意从事教师这个职业，真的是很感激他们。”

针对这个问题，一位物理教师/u/thatphysicsteacher写下了她的答案：

> Lots of responses and not many from teachers, so I'll throw in my hat. I went into teaching on accident. I was a physics major in undergrad and planning to study Physics Education Research for my PhD. However, it bothered me that I would be able to tell a teacher what to do with my research without having experience with their profession. So I was going to take a gap year and teach high school physics while my husband finished his degree. This way we could get a bit of income and I could get a bit of experience before starting my research.

“这个问题已经有很多答案了，但还没看到多少答案来自教师自己。所以我想试试。我是意外进入教师行业的。当时我正本科攻读物理专业，打算继续深造博士学位，研究物理教育课题。但是，如果没有教师职业的亲身经历，就去发表研究，指导教师们应该怎么怎么做，我觉的实在是不合适。所以我打算在间休一年，在等待我爱人攻克学位的同时，当一名高中教师。这样我们也能多一些收入。并且我在开始研究之前，也能获得一些实践经验。”

> We'll, long story short, I fell in love with teaching. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to not like. The meetings, the speakers telling you what to do with no experience, the government changing your requirements every few years, standardized tests, the emails, so much. But when you're in the classroom with your students, it can be magical. There's nothing like the light bulb moment. When you have been pulling them through a tough spot and they finally get it. When they ask you for advice or write you a little note at the end of the year saying they looked forward to your class. When they smile and shout your name when they see you at graduation. All the trouble and grading and long hours are suddenly worth it. If I reach just one kid, it's worth it.

“好吧，长话短说，我爱上了教书。不过别误解，我知道教书有很多无法令人喜欢的地方。冗长的会议，毫无经验的校董的指手画脚，政府每隔几年就对教师的要求作出改变，标准化的考试，各种邮件。。。。太多太多了。但是，一旦你走进教室，面对学生之后，一切都变得很神奇。我想不到这么有感性冲击的场景。当他们在你的努力帮助下，从学习的泥沼中扛过来的时候；当他们向你咨询建议的时候；当学期结束，他们递给你一张小纸条，说期待下个学期还能上你的课的时候；当毕业典礼中，他们欢笑着，大声喊着你的名字的时候。。。所有的困难，所有辛苦，所有的煎熬，突然都变得值得了。如果我能改变一个孩子，那就是值得的。”

> I think another huge reason is so they know they are loved. So many of these almost adults really struggle with their self worth and mental health. We want to show them that even though life is messy, you can be happy (and deserve to be happy). We try to help them wrestle with the real world as they try to find their way. We support them and try to keep them safe. We remind them that even if you have nothing else in this world, I believe in you. There's someone on your team wishing the world for you.

“我觉得另一个重要的原因，是教师能让学生们感受到他们是被爱着的。有太多这样半大不小的孩子，挣扎于自我信心的缺失，受迫于心理疾病的威胁。我们想要告诉他们，虽然生活纷扰凌乱，但你也应该去感受幸福（并且值得感受到幸福）。在他们试着找到自己的道路时，我们也在试着帮助他们，去抵抗现实世界的纷扰。我们提醒他么，即使你失去了一切，我们也仍然相信你、支持你。总有一个人，在希望你过得更好。”

> I am a teacher because my students deserve to graduate from high school as happy, healthy humans. I want them to have to tools to succeed in whatever the future holds for them. Maybe they'll know a little physics, too. But if they're happy and healthy, I'll take it.

“我之所以当老师，是因为我希望，我的学生能够开心、健康的从高中毕业。我希望，不论未来如何，他们能拿到走向成功的武器。当然，如果能学会一些物理，那自然更好。但是只要他们开心和健康，我就能欣然接受。”

翻译到这里，我觉得自己的笔力，还完全无法表达出这位老师文字之间的温暖与悸动。所以请读者好好再体味一遍原文。这才是园丁，这才是纷乱芜杂的社会风潮之中，仍然坚持擎着那一柱火光，为我们的未来，照亮道路的教师。

愿天下的学生都能遇到这样的老师。也愿天下的老师能有更值得他们付出的待遇与环境，可以放下现实生活的困扰，全心全意地培育我们的下一代。
