前日在Reddit上看到一则新闻：

> French teachers who find themselves at breaking point after years of being asked to do more with less took to the streets of Paris, Lyon, Nice and Bordeaux on Saturday, demanding a salary increase and better conditions for teachers and students.

法国的教师们上周六举行了全国范围的大游行，要求提高薪资，提高教师与学生的生存条件。

一位读者/u/NoWayRay评论道：

> Not a world of difference in the UK and US. Other places too probably. Why is one of the most important professions so routinely undervalued? I really don't understand why people go into teaching in those circumstances, I'm just grateful they do.

“英国、美国也都是一样糟糕。其他地方可能也差不都。为什么教师作为最重要的职业，却总是遭到政府如此长期地忽视? 我实在想不明白，这么差的条件下，为什么还有人能坚持教师这个职业。说真的，很感激他们的坚持。”

这个问题引发了很多关注。其中点赞人数最多的回答，来自一位高中物理教师/u/thatphysicsteacher。她是这么说的：

> Lots of responses and not many from teachers, so I'll throw in my hat. I went into teaching on accident. I was a physics major in undergrad and planning to study Physics Education Research for my PhD. However, it bothered me that I would be able to tell a teacher what to do with my research without having experience with their profession. So I was going to take a gap year and teach high school physics while my husband finished his degree. This way we could get a bit of income and I could get a bit of experience before starting my research.

“这个问题已经有很多人回答了，但我还没看到几个来自教师的回答。所以我想说说我作为物理老师的想法。我是而然进入教师行业的。我本科读的是物理专业，本来打算继续读博，研究方向选的是物理教育研究。但是我想，如果自己没有亲身当过老师的经历，凭空研究，到时候反而来指点老师们该如何如何，心里实在过意不去。所以毕业后我打算在间休一年，一边当高中教师，一边等我爱人毕业。这样我们也能多一些收入，并且我也能在开始研究之前，获得一些教师的实践经验。”

> We'll, long story short, I fell in love with teaching. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to not like. The meetings, the speakers telling you what to do with no experience, the government changing your requirements every few years, standardized tests, the emails, so much. But when you're in the classroom with your students, it can be magical. There's nothing like the light bulb moment. When you have been pulling them through a tough spot and they finally get it. When they ask you for advice or write you a little note at the end of the year saying they looked forward to your class. When they smile and shout your name when they see you at graduation. All the trouble and grading and long hours are suddenly worth it. If I reach just one kid, it's worth it.

“好吧，长话短说，最后我爱上了教书。当然，当老师也有很多讨厌的地方。没完没了的会议，毫无经验却又指手画脚的校董，时不时改动教学规范的政府部门，千篇一律标准化的考试，繁杂的邮件处理。。。。太多太多了。但是，一旦走进教室，面对学生的时候，一切都不同了。有太多令人感动的时候。当学生在你的帮助下，从困难的泥沼中爬出来的时候；当学生问你个人意见的时候；当学期结束，他们递给你一张小纸条，说希望下个学期还能上你的课的时候；当毕业典礼中，他们欢笑着，大声喊着你的名字的时候。。。所有的困难，所有辛苦，所有的煎熬，突然都变得值得了。只要我能改变一个孩子，那就是值得的。”

> I think another huge reason is so they know they are loved. So many of these almost adults really struggle with their self worth and mental health. We want to show them that even though life is messy, you can be happy (and deserve to be happy). We try to help them wrestle with the real world as they try to find their way. We support them and try to keep them safe. We remind them that even if you have nothing else in this world, I believe in you. There's someone on your team wishing the world for you.

“我觉得另一个重要的原因，是能让学生感受到他们是被爱着的。有太多即将成年的孩子，因为缺乏自信心而挣扎，受着心理健康的威胁。我们老师想要告诉学生们，虽然生活纷扰凌乱，但你也应该去感受幸福（并且你值得幸福）。在他们尝试寻找自己的道路的过程中，我们也试着帮助他们抵抗现实的纷扰。我们提醒他们，即使你失去了一切，我们也仍然相信你、支持你。总有一个人希望你过得更好。”

> I am a teacher because my students deserve to graduate from high school as happy, healthy humans. I want them to have to tools to succeed in whatever the future holds for them. Maybe they'll know a little physics, too. But if they're happy and healthy, I'll take it.

“我之所以当老师，是因为希望我的学生能够开心、健康的从高中毕业。我希望，不论未来如何，他们能拿到通向成功的钥匙。当然，如果能学会一些物理，那自然更好。就算不能，只要他们开心和健康，我就能欣然接受。”

翻译到这里，我觉得自己的笔力，还无法表达出这位老师文字之间的温暖与悸动。所以请读者好好再体味一遍原文。这才是园丁，这才是纷乱芜杂的社会风潮之中，仍然坚持擎着那一柱火光，为我们的未来照亮道路的教师。

愿天下的学生都能遇到这样的好老师。也愿天下的老师能有更值得他们付出的待遇与环境，可以放下现实生活的困扰，全心全意地培育我们的下一代。
